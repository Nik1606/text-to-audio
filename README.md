# text-to-audio
In this project, we tried to convert a user input text into audio.

The project uses gTTS API and playsound module. It uses some of inputs from an article posted on javapoin.com [Link: https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-convert-text-to-speech-in-python]

requirements.txt file contains reequired modules.

Program takes a input from user and saves it in a dynamic .txt file. Then a variable
named content reads content in a .txt file. By using playsound module, 
it is converted into exam.mp3 file. After execution of program, dynamically created 
.txt and .mp3 file gets deleted.
